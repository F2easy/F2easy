Apologies for the confusion. To ensure that exactly three cards are displayed per row, you can modify the CSS as follows: ```html {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %} <style> .card { display: flex; flex-direction: column; width: calc(33.33% - 20px); /* Adjust the width calculation as needed */ margin-bottom: 30px; /* Increase the margin-bottom for more space between rows */ background-color: white; padding: 20px; margin-right: 20px; /* Increase the margin-right for more space between cards */ } .card-title { font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; } .image-container { display: flex; justify-content: flex-end; } .drink-image { width: 150px; /* Adjust the width as needed */ } .card-wrapper { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between; gap: 40px; /* Increase the gap value for more space between cards */ } @media (max-width: 960px) { .card { width: calc(50% - 20px); /* Adjust the width calculation for smaller screens */ } } @media (max-width: 600px) { .card { width: 100%; /* Display one card per row on smaller screens */ } } </style> <h1>Shopping List</h1> <div class="card-wrapper"> {% for drink in drinks %} <div class="card"> <div class="card-content"> <span class="card-title"> Needed For <span style="color: {{ drink.name }}">{{ drink.name }}</span> </span> <img src="{{ drink.drink_image }}" class="drink-image"> <ul> <!-- Ingredient list here --> </ul> <a class="btn red sans" href="{% url 'shopping_delete' drink.id %}">Delete</a> <a class="btn blue sans" href="{% url 'shopping_update' drink.id %}">Update</a> </div> </div> {% endfor %} </div> {% endblock %} ``` In this updated code, I've added media queries to adjust the card width for different screen sizes. Here's how it works: - For screens with a maximum width of 960 pixels, the card width is set to `calc(50% - 20px)`, allowing two cards to be displayed per row. - For screens with a maximum width of 600 pixels, the card width is set to `100%`, ensuring that only one card is displayed per row. Please give this updated code a try, and the cards should now display exactly three per row on larger screens and adjust accordingly on smaller screens. Feel free to adjust the media query breakpoints and the card width calculations as needed.

Certainly! Here's some additional information about the cp command and how to use it in the Mac terminal:

The cp command stands for "copy" and is used to copy files or directories from one location to another.

The basic syntax for the cp command is as follows:

Copy
cp [source] [destination]
The [source] parameter specifies the file or directory you want to copy, and the [destination] parameter specifies the location where you want to copy it to.

If the [destination] is a directory, the file will be copied into that directory with the same name. If

It seems like you have included a section in your README file where you introduce yourself and provide information about your skills and interests. You have also included images and badges from external sources.

The image you included with the URL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SupianIDz/SupianIDz/main/coding.gif" shows an animated GIF of someone coding.

You have also added a trophy section using the GitHub Profile Trophy service. The URL "https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=f2easy" generates dynamically generated GitHub Stat Trophies based on your GitHub activity and achievements.

In the rest of your README file, you have provided information about your current learning focus, the topics you are knowledgeable about, and the programming languages and tools you are proficient in. You have also included your social media links.

Lastly, you have included two GitHub statistics cards using the GitHub Readme Stats service. The first card displays your GitHub stats, including the number of contributions, followers, and repositories. The second card shows the distribution of programming languages used in your repositories.

Overall, your README file provides a comprehensive overview of your skills, interests, and GitHub activity.

why doesnt this load

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

Poe
I apologize for the inconvenience. As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the internet or the ability to load external content, including images or URLs. So, I can't directly load or display the content from the URLs provided in your README file.

However, if you're experiencing issues with loading the content in your README file, it could be due to a variety of reasons:

Incorrect URLs: Make sure the URLs you have provided in your README file are correct and accessible. Double-check for any typos or missing characters.

Server or network issues: The external server hosting the content, such as images or badges, might be experiencing downtime or connectivity issues. Try accessing the URLs in a web browser to see if you can load the content directly.

Content removal or relocation: If the content has been removed or relocated from its original location, the URLs may no longer be valid. Ensure that the content you are referencing is still available at the provided URLs.

It's also worth noting that GitHub README files support Markdown syntax, so make sure you have correctly formatted the URLs and embedded them in the appropriate Markdown syntax for images or links.

If you need further assistance, please provide more details about the specific issues you're encountering, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot.

this doesnt load the image why is that

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

Poe
The reason the image doesn't load could be due to the following possibilities:

Incorrect URL: Double-check that the URL for the image is accurate and complete. If there's a typo or missing character in the URL, the image may not load.

Access restrictions: Ensure that the image file is publicly accessible. If it's hosted on a private repository or requires authentication, it may not be visible to everyone.

Server or network issues: Sometimes, the server hosting the image may be experiencing downtime or connectivity problems. In such cases, the image won't load until the server is back online.

File removal or relocation: If the image file has been removed or relocated from its original location, the URL will no longer be valid. Verify that the image file exists at the provided URL.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

Open the image URL directly in a web browser to see if it loads. If it doesn't, check for any errors or messages displayed by the browser.

Verify the URL by copying it and pasting it into a text editor or directly into the address bar of a web browser. Ensure that there are no extra spaces, missing characters, or typos.

If the image URL is incorrect or the image file has been removed, you may need to find an alternative source for the image or upload it to a reliable hosting service yourself.

By addressing these possibilities and ensuring the image URL is accurate and accessible, you should be able to resolve the issue and have the image display correctly in your README file.

I've removed the style tags and added the width="80" attribute to each language and tools image to make them larger. The container div uses inline styles (style="display: flex; align-items: center;") to achieve horizontal display and vertical alignment. Feel free to adjust the width value as needed.
